This little script made your life a little bit easier if you working with separated text items in Adobe Illustrator. With this script you can search and select text items that contains specific characters or word in their text contents.

This is a script. There's no installation needed for using it. 

You can use script by dropping script file `(TextSearchSelection.jsx)` over Illustrator.

Or select `"File" > "Scripts" > "Other Scripts..."` and select script file.

## How to Use
It's very simple to use. Just write single or multiple letters and script will search match from all text items in active document.

## About
This is old little script that I've done in 2014 for testing purposes. I updated it a while ago because needed it in one project. Maybe it's useful someone Illustrator user out there.
